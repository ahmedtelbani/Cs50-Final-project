## About Project:
**This is the final project for CS50 2022.**

<br>

**Assis Project:** is a web application makes your life easier.<br>
The application contains a set of different tools that help you in your daily tasks in particular and thus your life in general.<br>
The app can:
- Register new users and save their data.
- Take tasks for you.
- Suggests you a fun random task.
- Work pomodoro sessions.
- Take Notes and sort them nicely.
- Create a profile for each user that contains many settings.

## The reason I chose the project idea

The reason I chose the project idea is my great love for time management and productivity.

I wanted to make it easier for people, collect most of the tools they may need to manage their time, and develop themselves in one application, so that each person would be able to control his life, and use his time in creativity.

I chose to have this as a web application because of the ease and accessibility of it from all devices, and not only available for desktop or phone devices.

## Project Executive

I was able to complete a project like this, thanks to the CS50 team.

The course helped me understand a lot of advanced concepts well and I was able to practice them well.

The final project gave me the opportunity to make a good project out of my idea, and gave me all the tools I needed to do it.

## Peek at the app

 ### The app can take notes and display them smoothly.
 The application records tasks for each user - after he logs in - organizes and arranges them by date with adding each day tasks in a single group for easy access.

 The app can add new tasks with previous or upcoming dates as needed, delete existing tasks or modify them, and can mark the completed tasks smoothly.

 ### But what if you get bored of your day or do a lot of work tasks?
The application also suggests a lot of fun random activities and tasks that improve user mood, and give the user an opportunity to try something new and gain benefits from doing and discovering it. It provides all the necessary information about this activity, such as: the classification of the activity, the number of people needed to do this activity, and it determines whether it is an individual or group activity, whether its implementation costs money or not, and the price required for implementation if available, and gives you some links to help get started if you do not know the way already, and specifies the possibility of carrying out this activity.

You can repeat the request to suggest new activities an infinite number of times to come up with something that matches your personality.

### And here comes another question, which is: How can I do these tasks, whether daily tasks or the tasks suggested by the application?

The app also enables you to start pomodoro sessions to keep you control the time and ensure you don't get lost. You can give each task a number of pomodoros with a small break which to recharge to start a new pomodoro.

In the application there is a counter for pomodoro sessions, rest sessions and the time used in these sessions, to help you see your life with a broader and more comprehensive view, for the possibility of doing an analysis and taking some notes on your life.

### This leads us to another stage, which is taking notes.

The app takes notes, arranges and organizes it well. You can take a note, add a title and label to it, and display it in an easy-to-handle template.

- You can take as many notes as you want and the app will handle them.
- You can also delete notes that he already cares about and no longer need.
- You can also view the notes and categorize them according to each classification that the user has previously set.

such as: displaying all the notes of shopping, the university or the projects he is working on and the bright ideas that come to his mind, and navigating between them very smoothly.

### The app creates an integrated profile of your activity.

You can see the counter of the Pomodoro sessions, rest sessions and the time used in these sessions, and the user can change personal information such as: first name, last name, gender, change the password, and change the profile picture, where each user can upload one picture to his profile or replace it with another one or return to the picture Default profile.

You can add descriptive phrases for his personality and how he sees himself, for the possibility of developing his beliefs and his view of himself in a better way, forming the image he wants to be in the future, the goals he wants to achieve in his life, the actions he wants to modify and the habits he wants to acquire in order to develop himself.

You can also add some motivational phrases that he loves and believes in and sees that it fits with his life and principles and helps him to be motivated.
You can also permanently delete his account from the application, if he wants to.

User can see the date he joined this application, to help analyze his life, such as comparing his life after using the tools of this application and before, and how these tools affected his quality of life.

## Define project files:

### application.py :
This contains the main server-side code of the application and the basic functions to work.

### helpers.py :
This is a Cs50 helpers file contains the application auxiliary functions, to implement it in main app file.

### assis.db :
This is the primary application database.
Database stores all users, tasks and notes.

### static directory :
This is a folder contains all images, svg pictures, icons, users avatars and app CSS files.

### templates directory :
This is a folder contains all app HTML files, like: layout.html, login.html, register.html and all the rest of the application pages.

## Project Design:

The application has been completely designed by me, without using any framework, using:
- Pure HTML
- Pure Css
- Vanilla javascript
- Clean Code

The application is totally responsive to all media screens.

App has:
- A perfect three-level system of user input Validation (HTML, JavaScript, Python).
- Pretty responsive warning messages.
- Pretty responsive Popup windows.
- Nice confirmation notifications.
- A precise logic (Javascript, Python).

I first made a sketch to design the app, then I built the HTML Structure based on the server-side logic.
Then I used CSS features such as grid, flexbox and others to create responsive pages.
After that I used Javascript to make user input validation and interactive elements.

I hope you will like the application.
